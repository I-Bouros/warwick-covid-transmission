Summary figures:
- Prioritising the 75+ first scenario is performing best compared to other scenarios.
- No visible differences in number of infections between scenarios.
- The higher the percentage of known serology statuses, the smaller the number of deaths and infections.
  However these differences are negligible, (~0.07 per 100k for deaths between the 10% and 70%).

Scatter plots:
- The bigger reductions are observed in the number of hospitalisations compared to that of deaths for all scenarios and serology percentages.
- For countries with less income, the differences in deaths are almost impeceptible when varying the percentage of known serology statuses.
- The bigger the he percentage of known serology statuses, the smaller the number of deaths and hospitalisations.
