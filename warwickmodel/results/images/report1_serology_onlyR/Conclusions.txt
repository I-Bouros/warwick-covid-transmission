Summary figures:
- Prioritising the 75+ first scenario is performing best compared to other scenarios.
- No visible differences in number of infections between scenarios.
- The higher the percentage of known serology statuses, the smaller the number of deaths and infections.
  However these differences are negligible, (~0.07 per 100k for deaths between the 10% and 70%).

Scatter plots:
- The bigger the percentage of known serology statuses, the smaller the number of deaths and hospitalisations.
- However, such reductions are only modest in the number of hospitalisations and deaths for all scenarios and serology percentages.
- The differences observed are bigger in the case of higher income countries compared to the lower income countries considered.
