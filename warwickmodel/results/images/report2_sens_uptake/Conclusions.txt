Summary figures:
- Prioritising the 75+ first scenario is performing best compared to other scenarios.
- The differences between this and the next best scenario also start to decrease with the decrease in the levels of uptake.
  However, for 50% uptake we see the second best scenario is no longer equivalent to the third, as the lower uptake allows for more of the
  older age-groups to vaccinated, which we establised are more prone to both death and hospilatisation then their younger counterparts.
  (We can see that in the pie-charts)
- Comparing the different levels of uptake for each scenario, we observe that the higher the level of uptake, the less
  amount of years of life lost we observe, as expected.

Scatter plots:
- The similar reductions are observed in both the number of hospitalisations and years of life lost for all scenarios and serology percentages.
- The bigger the percentage of uptake, the smaller the number of years of life lost and hospitalisations for the best scenario. For the other strategies,
  (for which we start vaccinating younger people first, making us run out of boosters by the time we vaccinate the older, more at-risk individuals)
  we see an occassional inversion of these orders for the reason stated above.
