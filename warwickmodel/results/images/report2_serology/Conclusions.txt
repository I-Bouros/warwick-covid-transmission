Summary figures:
- Prioritising the 75+ first scenario is performing best compared to other scenarios.
- No visible differences in number of infections between scenarios.
- However, the higher the percentage of known serology statuses, the bigger the number of years of life lost for
  this first best scenario (75+ first) ~0.5 per 100k for years of life lost between the 10% and 70%. One explanation
  for this phenomenon is that in this way we neglect to vaccinate a larger proporion of the older W1, who are slightly
  more susceptible to getting infected and so dying then their younger counterparts, i.e. the number of years of life lost that would be
  averted by vaccinating more of the elderly age groups exceeds the number of years of life lost that would be averted by vaccinating
  more of the younger age groups. (We can see that in the pie-charts)

Scatter plots:
- The similar reductions are observed in both the number of hospitalisations and years of life lost for all scenarios and serology percentages.
- In general, the bigger the percentage of known serology statuses, the smaller the number of years of life lost and hospitalisations. For some strategies and countries,
  (for which we start vaccinating younger people first, making us run out of boosters by the time we vaccinate the older, more at-risk individuals)
  we see an occassional inversion of these orders for the reason stated above.
