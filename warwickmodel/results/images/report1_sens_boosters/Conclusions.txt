Summary figures:
- Prioritising the 75+ first scenario is performing best compared to other scenarios.
- No visible differences in number of infections between scenarios.
- The higher the percentage of boosters vailable, the smaller the number of deaths and infections.
  For the deaths, the number goes down by ~1 per 100k for deaths between the 5% and 20% population coverage.
- The differences between this and the next best scenario also start to decrease with the decrease in the levels of available boosters.
  However, for 20% population coverage we see the second best scenario is no longer equivalent to the third, but almost equal to the best scenario
  of vaccinating the 75+ first. This is due to the fact that as larger population coverage allows for more of the
  older age-groups to vaccinated, which we establised are more prone to both death and hospilatisation then their younger counterparts.
  (We can see that in the pie-charts)

Scatter plots:
- The similar reductions are observed in both the number of hospitalisations and deaths for all scenarios and serology percentages.
- The effects on the number of hospitalisations are reduced for the worse scenarios.
- The bigger the percentage of population coverage, the smaller the number of deaths and hospitalisations for all scenarios, as expected.
