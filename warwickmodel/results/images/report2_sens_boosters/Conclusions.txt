Summary figures:
- Prioritising the 75+ first scenario is yields the fewest number of years ol life lost
  compared to other scenarios.
- The differences between this and the next best scenario also start to decrease with the decrease in the levels of available boosters.
  However, for 20% population coverage we see the second best scenario is no longer equivalent to the third, but almost equal to the best scenario
  of vaccinating the 75+ first. This is due to the fact that as larger population coverage allows for more of the
  older age-groups to vaccinated, which we establised are more prone to both death and hospilatisation then their younger counterparts.
  (We can see that in the pie-charts)
- Comparing the different number of boosters for each scenario, we observe that the more boosters we have availble, the less
  amount of years of life lost we observe, as expected.


Scatter plots:
- The similar reductions are observed in both the number of hospitalisations and years of life lost for all scenarios and serology percentages.
- The effects on the number of hospitalisations are reduced for the worse scenarios.
- The bigger the percentage of population coverage, the smaller the number of years of life lost and hospitalisations for all scenarios, as expected.
